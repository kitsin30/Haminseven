                <p>Bind, codenamed “duality’ is set on a sandy piece of land, somewhere in Morocco. It has a standard layout with 2 bomb sites, but, with a small twist. Bind features 2 portals on the map, which can be used to travel faster to another side of the map. One of the portals is placed next to A short, whereas another is placed towards B Long. These portals can be used by both sides, for many different reasons. Whether it be escaping from a fight, or engaging onto an enemy, the portals are very efficient at doing any type of job that requires fast transportation. Here below is an image of both portals.</p>

                    <p>Icebox is Kingdom Corporation's port and cold research facility, located on a small Russian island in the Arctic. The secret facility was dedicated to the shipment of various resources, including radianite, along with being an archaeological excavation site, uncovering a crashed ancient Japanese ship.
                    This map features a ship as attacker spawn and various shipping containers all around the map. Both sites on the defender half include sectioned research labs with their own equipment and purpose. A sitencontains the large display chamber that showcases a samurai suit. Originally the samurai suit included a mask on display, however, Yoru broke into the facility using a rift and stole the mask.</p>

                    <p>If you want to go far, you’ll have to go up. A pair of sites split by an elevated center allows for rapid movement using two rope ascenders. Each site is built with a looming tower vital for control. Remember to watch above before it all blows sky-high.</p>
